## Description
This task covers the implementation of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as outlined in the initial project plan. The goal was to create a functional application that monitors posture via a webcam and provides real-time feedback in the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Application launches and displays the main window.
*   User can select from a list of available system cameras.
*   A "Calibrate" button sets the current head position as the correct reference.
*   A "Start/Stop" button toggles the monitoring process.
*   The UI displays the current posture status (e.g., "Correct", "Incorrect", "Needs Calibration").
*   All processing is done in a background thread to keep the UI responsive.
*   User settings (camera choice, calibration data) are saved and loaded between sessions.

## Definition of Done
*   Code for all core services (`Camera`, `Processing`, `Settings`) and the `MainWindow` is implemented.
*   Components are integrated and function as a cohesive application.
*   Basic functionality is manually tested and confirmed working.
