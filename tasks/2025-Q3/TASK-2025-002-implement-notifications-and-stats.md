## Description
This task covers the implementation of features planned for Phase 2: adding user notifications for prolonged incorrect posture and a statistics system to track posture habits over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   The application sends a system tray notification if the user's posture is incorrect for a configurable period.
*   An optional sound can be played with the notification.
*   The application logs the time spent in "Correct" and "Incorrect" states to a persistent local database (SQLite).
*   A "Statistics" button opens a new window displaying a pie chart of today's posture summary.
*   The application can be hidden to the system tray and continue monitoring in the background.

## Definition of Done
*   `NotificationService`, `StatisticsService`, and `StatisticsWindow` are implemented.
*   Services are integrated into the main application flow.
*   The new features are manually tested and confirmed working.
